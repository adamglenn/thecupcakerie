  The Cupcakerie opened in Downtown Morgantown on September 23, 2011. After 12
  years downtown, Anna Carrier, the owner of The Cupcakerie Café & Frosé, saw
  the opportunity to purchase the building that was  formerly Slight Indulgence
  and opened the gourmet café in March 2024. 


  The Café is a community hub where friends and families come together to enjoy good company and great food. In addition to our signature cupcakes, we offer a selection of savory sandwiches, fresh salads, and the best wine and local beer we can get our hands on. Pair your treat with one of our expertly crafted coffee beverages, a refreshing tea, or a frosé, and you've got the perfect recipe for a delightful day. We are committed to providing a warm and welcoming environment where everyone feels at home, and we can't wait to share our passion for delicious food and heartfelt hospitality with you!
